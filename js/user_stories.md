As a BusMall account manager, I want to know the popularity of featured items so that I order & stock quantities appropriately.

As a member of BusMall product advertising, I want the app to display results a way so that the customer's response isn't tained by the overall popularity of of a given item. 

As the Marketing Team, I want to know what percentage of times an item was clicked in relation to how often it was displayed.

As a customer I want a clean selection of items to choose from so I can escape the hellscape that is commuting in Seattle by retreating into the sweet, warm embrace of consumer fetishism.

As a Creative Director, I want the BusMall app to look minimalist, because Hipsters are way into Minimalism these days.
